# Web Alexa IoT Infrared Remote

This is a web application built using .NET 7.0 and Angular 15, designed to manage infrared signals and bind those signals to a specific alexa compatible switch so the user can use the voice activation to send ir signals to their devices. See [diagram](https://i.imgur.com/noVu3ln.png).

The signals displayed in the application are retrieved from a NodeMCU microcontroller, which is responsible for receiving and sending the infrared signals.

This web application was developed with the help of a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-build-an-e-commerce-app-with-net-core-and-angula), which provided guidance on building web applications with .NET and Angular. It has been customized to work seamlessly with the Alexa IoT Infrared Remote project, providing a convenient and efficient way for users to manage their signals.
